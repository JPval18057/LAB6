# TIVAWARE REGISTER CONFIGURATION

This project's goal was to become familiar with the ARM CORTEX M4 architecture. By using TIVAWARE and the registers in the datasheet, I was able to control the system clock, digital IO pins functionalities, PWM module, Timers and Uart module. Since the switches bounce naturally, I made a debouncing algoritm integrating the timer capabilities, in order to read accurately the switches' states and control the main program accordingly.
